# Self Eval
### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel confident. The process for creating arrays and using the methods is straightforward, and I know that if I forget how to do something, there is plenty of information on Ruby Doc.
### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I would like to look at more of the Array methods listed on Ruby Doc and try them out on my own time.

### What questions do you have about Arrays?
- I am a little bit confused on how "!" impacts the array methods' output, and when I would need to use it. When researching the .reverse method, I realized that if I did not include "!," it would not change the original array, but if I included "!" at the end of .reverse, it would change the array when called. Does calling an array using the .reverse method without "!" store the reversed array somewhere else?
